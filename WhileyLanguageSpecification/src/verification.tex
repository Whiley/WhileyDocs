\chapter{Verification}
The Whiley programming language supports {\em specifications} on functions, methods and data types which can be {\em statically verified} at compile time.  Verification operates in an intra-procedural fashion based on a modified and extended version of Hoare logic~\cite{Hoare69}.  To benefit from verification, programmers must provide specifications for their functions, methods and data types;  additionally, they must provide \gls{loop_invariant}s and other \gls{assertion}s to guide the verifier.
