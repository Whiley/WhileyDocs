\chapter{Definite Assignment}
\label{c_definite_assignment}

The Whiley programming language requires that variables are known at \gls{compile_time} to be {\em definitely assigned} (i.e. that they are defined before used).  A conservative approach is taken to determining whether or not this is the case.  This ensures the language can be compiled efficiently, but also means that some provably correct programs are not valid Whiley programs.  In this chapter, we specify the process by which definite assignment is determined.

\section{Overview}

The following illustrates a simple function which will be rejected by the compiler because it cannot determine definite assignment for all variables:

\begin{lstlisting}
function f(int x) -> (int r):
   int y
   if x < 0:
       y = 1
   return x + y
\end{lstlisting}

In the above program, variable \lstinline{y} is {\em not} definitely assigned before its use in the \lstinline{return} statement.  This is because there is an \gls{execution_path} through the function which reaches the \lstinline{return} statement and on which variable \lstinline{y} is not defined.  In fact, there are {\em two} possible execution paths through this function, but variable \lstinline{y} is only defined on one of them.  Observe that, since it is a parameter, variable \lstinline{x} is automatically considered to have been defined on entry to the function.

\begin{lstlisting}
function f(int x) => int:
   int y
   while x < 0:
       y = 1
       x = x + 1
   return x + y
\end{lstlisting}

Some examples.  Clarify definitely assigned versus maybe assigned. Clarify examples which are provably correct but not valid Whiley programs.  This includes loops and unfeasible paths.

\section{Execution Paths}

Depth first search over control-flow graph.  What is an infeasible path?


\section{Parameters}

Parameters are defined on entry to a function or method.  However, returns are not.

\section{Variable Definitions}

Discussion of what are definite assignment statements.  In particular, update operations are not definitely assignments, neither are assignments through references.

\section{Variable Uses}

Discussion of parameters as being considered definitely assigned on entry to a function or method.
