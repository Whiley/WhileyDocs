\section{Forward/Backward Reasoning}

Introduction to reasoning about a function in a forwards or backwards direction.  For forwards direction, need a staged approach where we eventually introduce the concept of a skolem.  Cover control-flow constructs upto, but not including loops.  This includes if-conditions, switch statements, function calls, array assignments, reference assignments, etc.  Also, introduce basic concept of a weakest precondition versus a strongest postcondition.  Introduce control-flow graph and the path sensitive traversal?
