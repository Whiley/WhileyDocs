\chapter{Specifying Functions and Data}
Introduction to what pre-/post-conditions are, and the important aspects of logic (e.g. quantification).  Clarify that there are different levels of specification, ranging from the minimum to illustrate lack of runtime error to the complete specification that a function is correct.

\section{Preconditions and Postconditions}
A {\em precondition} is a condition over the parameters of a function
that is required to be true when the function is called.  The body of
the function can then use this to make assumptions about the possible
values of the parameters.  Likewise, a {\em postcondition} is a
condition over the return values of a function which is required to be
true after the function is called.  As a very simple example, consider
the following function which accepts a positive integer and returns a
non-negative integer (i.e. natural number):
\begin{lstlisting}
function decrement(int x) => (int y) 
// Parameter x must be greater than zero
requires x > 0
// Return must be greater or equal to zero
ensures y >= 0:
    //
    return x - 1
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the \lstinline{requires} and \lstinline{ensures} clauses define
the function's precondition and postcondition.  With verification
enabled, the Whiley compiler will verify that the
implementation of this function meets its specification.  In fact, we
can see this for ourselves by manually constructing an appropriate
{\em verification condition} (that is, a logical condition whose truth
establishes that the implementation meets its specification).  In this
case, the appropriate verification condition is
 \lstinline{x > 0 ==> x-1 >= 0}.  Unfortunately, although constructing a verification
condition by hand was possible in this case, in general it's difficult
if not impossible for more complex functions.

The Whiley compiler reasons about functions by exploring the different
control-flow paths through their bodies.  Furthermore, as it learns
more about the variables used in the function, it automatically takes
this into account.  For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
function abs(int x) => (int y)
// Return value cannot be negative
ensures y >= 0:
    //
    if x >= 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
\end{lstlisting}
The Whiley compiler verifies that the implementation of this function
meets its specification.  At this point, it is worth considering in
more detail what this really means.  Since the Whiley compiler
performs verification at {\em compile-time}, it does not consider
specific values when reasoning about a function's implementation.
Instead, it considers all possible input values for the function which
satisfy its precondition.  In other words, when the Whiley compiler
verifies a function's implementation meets its specification, this
means it does so {\em for all possible input values}.  

\section{Data Type Invariants}

The above illustrates a function specification given through explicit pre- and
post-conditions.  However, we may also employ {\em constrained types}
to simplify it as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
type nat is (int n) where n >= 0
type pos is (int p) where p > 0

function f(pos x) => (nat n)
// Return must differ from parameter
ensures n != x:
    //
    return x-1
\end{lstlisting}

Here, the \lstinline{type} declaration includes a \lstinline{where}
clause constraining the permissible values for the type ($\$$
represents the variable whose type this will be).  Thus,
\lstinline{nat} defines the type of non-negative integers (i.e. the
natural numbers).  Likewise, \lstinline{pos} gives the type of
positive integers and is implicitly a subtype of \lstinline{nat}
(since the constraint on \lstinline{pos} implies that of
\lstinline{nat}).  We consider that good use of constrained types is
critical to ensuring that function specifications remain as readable
as possible.

The notion of type in Whiley is more fluid than found in typical
languages.  In particular, if two types ${\tt T_1}$ and ${\tt T_2}$
have the same {\em underlying} type, then ${\tt T_1}$ is a subtype of
${\tt T_2}$ iff the constraint on ${\tt T_1}$ implies that of ${\tt
  T_2}$.  Consider the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
 type anat is (int x) where x >= 0
 type bnat is (int x) where 2*x >= x

 function f(anat x) => bnat:
     return x
\end{lstlisting}
In this case, we have two alternate (and completely equivalent)
definitions for a natural number (we can see that \lstinline{bnat} is
equivalent to \lstinline{anat} by subtracting \lstinline{x} from both sides).
The Whiley compiler is able to reason that these types are equivalent
and statically verifies that this function is correct.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{ex}
The function \lstinline{neg()} returns the arithmetic negation of a value.
For example, \lstinline{neg(1) = -1}.  An implementation of
this function is given as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
function neg(int x) => (int r):
    return -x
\end{lstlisting}
Provide an appropriate {\em post-condition} for this function.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
The \lstinline{swap} function accepts to integers and returns them
with their order swapped.  The signature for the function is:
\begin{lstlisting}
function swap(int x, int y) => (int a, int b):
    ...
\end{lstlisting}
Provide an appropriate specification and implementation for this function.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}

A {\em natural} number is an integer which is greater-than-or-equal to
zero.  The following function adds three natural numbers together to produce a natural number:
\begin{lstlisting}
function sum3(int x, int y, int z) => (int r)
// No parameter can be negative
requires ...
// Return value cannot be negative
ensures ...:
    //
    return x + y + z
\end{lstlisting}
Complete the given \lstinline{requires} and \lstinline{ensures}
clauses based on the given English descriptions.

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The following function computes the absolute difference between two values:

\begin{lstlisting}
function diff(int x, int y) => (int r):
    //
    if x > y:
        return x - y
    else:
        return y - x
\end{lstlisting}

A {\em pre-condition} of this function is that parameter \lstinline{x}
is between \lstinline{0} and \lstinline{255} (inclusive) and,
likewise, that variable \lstinline{y} is between \lstinline{-128} and
\lstinline{127} (inclusive).  Provide a partial specification for
this function which constraints the ranges of the input and output
variables as tightly as possible.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used organisation of dates.
A well-known saying for remembering the number of days in each month
is the following:
\begin{quote}
``Thirty days hath September, April, June and November.  All the rest
have thirty-one, except February which has twenty-nine ...''
\end{quote}
Note, in this exercise, we will ignore the issue of leap years.  A
simple function for returning a date can be defined as follws:
\begin{lstlisting}
constant Jan is 1
constant Feb is 2
constant Mar is 3
constant Apr is 4
constant May is 5
constant Jun is 6
constant Jul is 7
constant Aug is 8
constant Sep is 9
constant Oct is 10
constant Nov is 11
constant Dec is 12

function getDate() => (int day, int month, int year):
    ...
\end{lstlisting}
Provide a specification for this function to ensure the returned date
is valid (ignoring leap years).  Furthermore, provide a simple
implementation which meets this specification.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
A well-known puzzle is that of the three water jugs.  In this
exercise, we will consider a cut down version of this which consists
of two water jugs: a small jug (containing three litres) and a large
jug (containing five litres).  The goal is to complete the
specification of the following function for pouring water from the
small jug into the large jug:

\begin{lstlisting}
function pourSmall2Large(int smallJug, int largeJug) => 
                        (int smallJugAfter, int largeJugAfter)
// The small jug holds between 0 and 3 litres (before)
requires ...
// The large jug holds between 0 and 5 litres (before)
requires ...
// The small jug holds between 0 and 3 litres (after)
ensures ...
// The large jug holds between 0 and 5 litres (after)
ensures ...
// The amount in both jugs is unchanged by this function
ensures ...
// Afterwards, either the small jug is empty or the large jug is full
ensures ...:
    //
    if smallJug + largeJug <= 5:
        // indicates we're emptying the small jug
        largeJug = largeJug + smallJug
        smallJug = 0
    else:
        // indicates we're filling up the medium jug    
        smallJug = largeJug + smallJug
        largeJug = 5
    // Done
    return smallJug, largeJug
\end{lstlisting}
Complete the missing \lstinline{requires} and \lstinline{ensures}
clauses based on the given English descriptions.  Does the implementation meet the given specification?
\end{ex}
