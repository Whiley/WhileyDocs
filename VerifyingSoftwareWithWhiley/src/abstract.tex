  The aim of this document is to provide a short introduction to the
  Whiley programming language, in order to get you up and running
  quickly.  However, it is not intended to be a definitive reference.
  We'll walk through a number of simple examples illustrating the most
  interesting features of Whiley, and show you how to get it up and
  running.  We will be assuming some rudimentary knowledge of
  programming.
